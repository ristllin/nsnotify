"""
Phase 2 — Per-session state records and the verb→State mapping used by all
harness adapters (Phase 3 / 4).

A "verb" is the short action tag that led-report or the harness adapter sends
to the broker (e.g. "start", "running", "done").  The broker maps it to a State
here so that harness adapters don't need to import state.py directly.

# Idle-eviction TTL: free the segment if no event arrives in this many seconds.
# This is the reaper for sessions that vanished WITHOUT a clean "end" event — a
# hard kill (closing the terminal, `kill`, force-quit) terminates the harness
# before its SessionEnd/`end` hook can run, so the broker never hears "Offline"
# and the session sticks at its last state. A graceful exit still frees the
# segment INSTANTLY via the hook; the TTL only catches the abrupt-kill case.
#
# TWO windows, keyed on the session's last state (a segment's last_event is only
# refreshed by inbound events, and a call-to-action fires exactly ONE event then
# goes quiet while it waits on the human — so a single TTL blind to state would
# reap a live "needs you" session):
#
#   SESSION_TTL_S (120 s, was 900 s) — benign/ambient states (Idle / Running /
#     Done). A killed session almost always lands here, so 2 min clears it
#     promptly. Trade-off: a genuinely idle-but-alive session is also dropped
#     after the TTL, but it reappears the instant it does anything. `--ttl` tunes
#     this window (see server.py).
#
#   CTA_TTL_S (900 s) — call-to-action states (WaitingInput / AwaitingApproval /
#     Error): a job blocked ON the human. Kept at the original 15 min so the
#     ring's highest-value signal can't vanish while it's still pending. A
#     killed CTA session therefore lingers longer — the safe direction (better
#     to over-show a pending job than to hide a live one). Never shorter than
#     the benign window (the broker clamps: max(benign_ttl, CTA_TTL_S)).

                        # clears killed sessions far sooner anyway

# States that mean "a human needs to act" (or a failure worth surfacing). Held
# on the ring for CTA_TTL_S, not the short SESSION_TTL_S. Mirrors the firmware's
# own CTA-hold design (input/approval/error never silently expire).
