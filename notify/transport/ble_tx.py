"""
Phase 5 — BLE GATT transport (host = central/writer, ESP32 = peripheral/server).

Shared contract with the Nimbus firmware (`src/net/ble_notifier.cpp`) — the
UUIDs below are pinned on BOTH sides; never regenerate them.

GATT layout (one custom primary service):
  FRAME_CHAR   — Write Without Response — host→ESP: one COMPLETE nsn wire
                 packet per write, byte-identical to the serial stream
                 ([SOF 0xAA][LEN][payload≤68][CRC8-MAXIM], ≤71 bytes).
                 No transport-level chunking or re-framing.
  STATUS_CHAR  — Notify — ESP→host, tag-prefixed binary:
                 [0x01, protoVer, fwMaj, fwMin]  conn ack ("link ready")
                 [0x02, seq]                     seq echo after a frame applies
                 [0x03, ...]                     reserved (button/encoder)
  CONFIG_CHAR  — Read — [ver, ledCount, brightness, flags] diagnostic snapshot
                 (Write reserved for v2; not consumed by the broker in v1).

MTU: both sides target ATT_MTU 247; hard requirement is ≥74 (71-byte packet +
3-byte ATT header).  macOS/CoreBluetooth negotiates automatically (typ. 185+);
Linux/BlueZ reports mtu_size == 23 until negotiated — we re-check after
connect and hard-fail the session rather than silently truncate.

Threading: bleak is asyncio; the broker calls send() synchronously from its
own event loop.  A daemon worker thread runs a private asyncio loop hosting
the BleakClient and the scan→connect→serve→backoff state machine.  send()
never blocks: it stores the frame in a latest-wins mailbox (frames are
idempotent full state) and wakes the worker; it returns True iff the device
is currently connected — the same best-effort "delivered" semantics as
SerialTransport.  On every (re)connect the worker re-enables the STATUS CCCD
(forgetting this is the classic "device acks nothing after reconnect" bug)
and re-sends the current frame in full.
