# nimbus-notify

A Python host broker that watches your AI coding-agent sessions — **Claude
Code**, **Codex**, and **Mistral Vibe** — via lightweight hooks, and pushes
their live status (running / waiting for you / needs approval / done /
errored) to a physical display device over serial (USB-CDC) or Bluetooth LE,
using a small documented binary protocol ([nsn](docs/protocol.md)).

If you've got several agent sessions going in parallel across different
terminals and projects, nimbus-notify gives you one glanceable place — an LED
ring, an e-ink panel, whatever device you point it at — to see which ones
are still working and which ones are waiting on you.

## Status

Beta. The core broker, all three harness adapters, and both transports are
implemented and tested (`python3 -m pytest`). This is a fresh split out of a
private monorepo into its own package — see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Compatible devices

nimbus-notify speaks a documented, transport-agnostic wire protocol — see
[docs/protocol.md](docs/protocol.md). Any device that implements the
protocol's serial or BLE side can be driven by this broker; nothing here is
tied to a specific piece of hardware. If you build (or already have) a
microcontroller project with an LED strip, an e-ink panel, or any other
status display, point it at this broker.

## Install

```bash
pip install nimbus-notify
```

This installs three commands on your `PATH`:

- `nimbus-notify-broker` — the daemon that maintains session state and talks to
  your device.
- `led-report` — the small CLI that harness hooks call to report events
  into the broker (fire-and-forget; never blocks your agent).
- `nimbus-notify` — setup helper: `install-hooks` wires `led-report` into your
  harness config (idempotent, preserves existing hooks); `doctor` checks your setup.

> **If `pip` itself errors** before it reaches this package (e.g. a Python 3.14
> `pyexpat`/`libexpat` dylib mismatch on macOS), that's a broken host pip — use
> [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/): `uv tool install nimbus-notify`. See
> [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md#1-install) for the caveats.

To hack on it, install from source instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ristllin/nimbus-notify.git
cd nimbus-notify
pip install -e .
```

## Quickstart

1. Install the package (above).
2. **Connect your device** to this computer — over USB or Bluetooth. See
   [Connecting your device](#connecting-your-device) below (it's one command).
3. Wire up the harness(es) you use — see [Harnesses](#harnesses) below.
4. Start the broker (if it isn't already up from step 2):
   ```bash
   nimbus-notify-broker            # or: --transport ble   /   --transport auto
   ```
5. Start (or resume) an agent session in a wired-up harness. Its status
   should now be reported to the broker, and forwarded to your device.

If you use Claude Code, the fastest path is the bundled slash commands —
see [Claude Code plugin](#claude-code-plugin) below.

## Connecting your device

The broker talks to your status device **one of two ways** — you don't need
both, pick whichever fits:

### Option A — USB cable (simplest)

Plug the device into your computer with a USB cable and run:

```bash
nimbus-notify-broker --transport serial      # or just: nimbus-notify-broker
```

The broker auto-detects the port. That's it — no pairing, no setup. Good for a
device that sits on your desk next to the machine. (To pin a specific port:
`--transport serial --port /dev/cu.usbmodem101`.)

### Option B — Bluetooth, no cable (wireless)

If the device is powered from a wall plug / battery and you **don't** want a USB
cable to your computer, use Bluetooth LE. There is **nothing to pair in System
Settings** — macOS bonds on demand the first time the broker touches the device:

1. **Power on the device** and make sure it's in **Notifier** mode and in radio
   range. (Notifier is the status-light mode; if the device is in Orchestrator
   mode, switch it from the device's knob menu or its web page.)
2. Run the broker **in the foreground**, once:
   ```bash
   nimbus-notify-broker --transport ble
   ```
3. The **first** time, macOS completes a silent "Just Works" bond (no code to
   type, no dialog). Leave the broker running for a few seconds — the device's
   ring will start reflecting your sessions once a frame arrives.

> **Why foreground the first time?** macOS only finishes the bond for a process
> in your normal login session, so don't background it (`nohup … &`) for the
> *first* connect. After the bond is stored (on both the Mac and the device's
> flash) every later run is transparent and can be backgrounded or run as a
> [service](#running-persistently). Full detail + un-bonding:
> [Bonding the BLE link](#bonding-the-ble-link-one-time).

**Which do I have?** If you flashed the firmware yourself over USB, the cable is
already there — use Option A. If the device is across the desk on its own power,
use Option B. `--transport auto` picks serial when a board is plugged in at
startup, else Bluetooth.

> **First time with a brand-new device?** Getting the device onto your Wi-Fi,
> naming it, and choosing Notifier vs Orchestrator is a separate one-time setup
> done from the **device itself** (its setup Wi-Fi + a QR code), not from this
> broker — see the Nimbus
> [First-time setup guide](https://ristllin.github.io/Nimbus/docs/getting-started/first-time-setup).
> For plain Notifier-over-Bluetooth you don't even need Wi-Fi — just Option B above.

## Harnesses

nimbus-notify supports three AI coding harnesses today. Each harness reports
events (session start, a tool running, waiting on your approval, done,
errored, session end) by calling `led-report <harness> <verb>` from a hook.

**The fastest way to wire any harness is the installer** (idempotent, keeps your
existing hooks, safe to re-run):

```bash
nimbus-notify install-hooks                       # all harnesses
nimbus-notify install-hooks --harness claude --dry-run   # preview
```

The manual per-harness steps below are the fallback (and what the installer does).

### Claude Code

`nimbus-notify install-hooks --harness claude` writes this for you. To do it by
hand, merge [`hooks/claude/settings.json`](hooks/claude/settings.json)'s `hooks`
block into your `~/.claude/settings.json`, preserving any hooks you already
have (append to each event's array rather than replacing it). It wires up
`SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `Notification`, `Stop`,
`StopFailure`, and `SessionEnd`. ⚠ The "needs you" ring uses the **`Notification`**
event — not `PermissionRequest` (a Codex event name that Claude Code never emits).

### Codex

Merge [`hooks/codex/hooks.json`](hooks/codex/hooks.json) into
`~/.codex/hooks.json`, then enable hooks and the notify bridge in
`~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[features]
hooks = true

notify = ["led-report", "codex-notify"]
```

### Mistral Vibe

Vibe has no native session start/stop hook, so the broker also runs a
background watcher over `~/.vibe/logs/session/` to detect new sessions and
infer human-in-the-loop waits (if a tool call starts but doesn't finish
within a timeout, that's treated as "awaiting approval").

Enable experimental hooks in `~/.vibe/config.toml`:

```toml
enable_experimental_hooks = true
```

Then merge [`hooks/vibe/hooks.toml`](hooks/vibe/hooks.toml) into
`~/.vibe/hooks.toml` (requires Vibe v2.15.0+ for `before_tool` /
`after_tool` / `post_agent_turn`).

### Claude Code plugin

This repo is also a Claude Code plugin (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`). If
you install it as a plugin, two slash commands become available:

- `/nsnotify-setup` — installs the Python package, merges the Claude Code
  hooks automatically, checks whether the broker is running, and prints
  the manual steps for Codex/Vibe.
- `/nsnotify-status` — shows current session states without needing to look
  at the device.

## Transports

Pick a transport with `--transport`:

```bash
nimbus-notify-broker --transport serial   # default
nimbus-notify-broker --transport ble
nimbus-notify-broker --transport auto     # serial if a device is plugged in at
                                      # startup, else BLE
```

- **Serial** auto-detects a likely USB-CDC port (Espressif native-USB VID
  `0x303A`, or common USB-UART bridge chips), or pin one explicitly:
  `nimbus-notify-broker --transport serial --port /dev/cu.usbmodem101`.
- **BLE** requires your device to be powered on, flashed with firmware that
  advertises the nsn BLE service, and in range. Optionally pin a specific
  device: `nimbus-notify-broker --transport ble --ble-address <address>`
  (a CoreBluetooth UUID on macOS, a MAC address on Linux). Without
  `--ble-address`, the broker scans for the nsn service UUID.

Transport selection happens once at startup — there's no live failover
between serial and BLE mid-session in this version.

### Session eviction (`--ttl`)

A session that ends **cleanly** (`/exit`, Ctrl-D) frees its ring segment
instantly via the `SessionEnd` hook. A session that is **hard-killed** (closing
the terminal, `kill`, force-quit) never runs that hook, so the broker reaps it
after an idle timeout instead:

```bash
nimbus-notify-broker --ttl 120   # default: drop a silent benign session after 120 s
```

- `--ttl SECONDS` sets the window for **benign** states (idle / running / done).
  Lower it for a snappier ring; raise it to keep quiet-but-alive sessions on the
  ring longer. Floored at 5 s.
- **Call-to-action** states (awaiting approval / awaiting input / error) always
  hold **900 s** regardless of `--ttl`, so a job that's blocked *on you* can't
  quietly disappear from the ring while it's still pending.

### Bonding the BLE link (one time)

Recent Nimbus firmware **secures the BLE link** (bonded + encrypted, LE Secure
Connections), so a device won't accept frames from an un-bonded computer — this
stops anyone in radio range from painting your ring. Bonding is **automatic**
(macOS "Just Works", no code to type) — but there are two things to know:

- **Nimbus does *not* appear in System Settings → Bluetooth.** That list only
  shows recognized device types (keyboards, mice, audio). A custom BLE
  peripheral is invisible there by design — don't look for it. Bonding happens
  on-demand when the broker first touches the device, not by picking it in a
  list.
- **Do the first bond with the broker in the foreground.** macOS only completes
  a bond for a process running in your normal login session — a fully detached
  process (e.g. `nohup … & disown`) is too detached and the bond silently fails.
  So the *first* time, just run `nimbus-notify-broker --transport ble` in a normal
  terminal and leave it up for a few seconds. Once bonded, the bond persists on
  both the device (flash) and your Mac, and every session after that is
  transparent — you can then run it backgrounded or as a service (below).

To un-bond: on the device, *Connectivity → Forget paired devices* (or the
`FORGETBONDS` console command); the Mac side clears on its own next connect.

> The firmware also carries a dormant MITM/passkey mode (it shows a 6-digit code
> on its e-ink screen). It's off by default because macOS won't surface the
> passkey-entry dialog for a broker-triggered pairing of a custom peripheral, so
> that pairing can't complete without a companion app.

## Running persistently

For day-to-day use you'll want the broker running in the background
whenever you're coding, not started by hand each time — it's a long-lived
listener the session hooks fire into, so if it isn't running your device just
stops updating.

### Recommended: `--install-service`

One command installs (and later removes) the auto-start service — a macOS
launchd LaunchAgent or a Linux systemd user unit — that starts the broker at
every login/reboot:

```bash
nimbus-notify-broker --install-service     # enable auto-start
nimbus-notify-broker --uninstall-service   # remove it
```

**⚠ macOS + BLE:** run `nimbus-notify-broker --transport ble` in the foreground
**once** first to complete the "Just Works" bond (a fully-detached process can't
— see [Bonding the BLE link](#bonding-the-ble-link-one-time)); serial needs no
bond. The service uses
`--transport auto` (serial if a board is plugged at boot, else BLE).

The rest of this section documents what `--install-service` writes, if you'd
rather manage it by hand.

### macOS (launchd)

`--install-service` writes `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nimbus-notify.broker.plist`
(equivalent to creating it yourself):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
  "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>Label</key><string>com.nimbus-notify.broker</string>
  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
    <string>/usr/bin/env</string>
    <string>nimbus-notify-broker</string>
    <string>--transport</string>
    <string>auto</string>
  </array>
  <key>RunAtLoad</key><true/>
  <key>KeepAlive</key><true/>
  <key>StandardOutPath</key><string>/tmp/nimbus-notify-broker.log</string>
  <key>StandardErrorPath</key><string>/tmp/nimbus-notify-broker.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Then:

```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.nimbus-notify.broker.plist
```

### Linux (systemd, user service)

Create `~/.config/systemd/user/nimbus-notify-broker.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=nimbus-notify broker

[Service]
ExecStart=%h/.local/bin/nimbus-notify-broker --transport auto
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Then:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now nimbus-notify-broker
```

Adjust `ExecStart` to wherever `pip install -e .` put the entry point
(check with `which nimbus-notify-broker`).

## The nsn wire protocol

A short summary — full details in [docs/protocol.md](docs/protocol.md).

```
[SOF 0xAA] [LEN] [payload: LEN bytes] [CRC8-MAXIM]
```

The payload starts with magic byte `0x4E`, then a sequence number, then up
to 16 fixed-size segment records (state, hue, animation, LED span) plus a
global brightness — enough for a device to render a full status frame from
a single self-contained packet, no persistent client-side state required.
The reference encoder/decoder is [`notify/broker/frame.py`](notify/broker/frame.py).
